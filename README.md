# Q-Learning-Trading-Agent
This repository contains an implementation of a trading agent based on Q-learning. The agent is trained on historical Bank of America data and tested on General Electric data. The code aims to learn a policy (series of actions) that maximizes the final value of the portfolio by simulating buy and sell trades on daily data.
